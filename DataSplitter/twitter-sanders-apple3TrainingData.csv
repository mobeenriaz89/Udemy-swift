Neg,It took @apple about 7 years just to figure out how to properly syncronize an iPhone.  WOW!  #ios5
Neg,@apple So I went to the 5th Ave store and was told I could wait about 4 hours to get a 4S. Needless to say I'm back at the hotel relaxing.

Neg,@robert_terpstra no worries bud ps: they're saying that the 4s is having a lot of network issues right now. (I'm @apple for mac problems)
Neg,I hate you @apple for not sending Toledooh @bestbuy any @iPhone for @verizon even after I pre ordered!!!
Neg,@pmphillips @apple If my non-Apple equipment broke this often I guess I'd need an Asus genius bar. But it doesn't so I don't :-)
Neg,Why is the new @apple iPhone OS duplicating all my iCal events? There's 2 of everything. How do I fix it? (tried turning iCloud off)

Neg,I sure as hell better be able to restore my calendar events. Terrible bug apple! @apple #icloud #anothericloudfail
Neg,I really hate that @apple won't let you hide the Newsstand app or move it into a folder. It serves no purpose for me.
Neg,Life was much easier when @apple and @BlackBerry were just fruits!
Neg,@apple No location reminders on ipad2! That was the point of updating to iOS 5
Neg,Comparing @Office #live with @google #apps and @apple #iCloud  I do not see #iCloud leading the crowd. Do you agree ?
Neg,RT @MikeFerri: If @apple doesn't fix iOS5 this week I'm buying a droid #emptythreats

Neg,This is the first time I've been unhappy with any @apple product... Disappointed and the Internet seems as confused as I am right now.
Neg,After a week or so with @Apple's #iOS5 I'm considering going back to #jailbroken 4.2 - same features as 5 plus more. Not as stable though.
Neg,Had issues with #Siri reaching network today. Too many uses or my signal? @apple
Neg,The new iOS5 completely failed at upgrading the phone. Now I'm stuck in this restore loop. Thanks @apple for wasting my day. Can i undo?
Neg,Is it me or does #iPhone4s run a little warm sometimes? @apple
Neg,@apple WTF why can we not add the newsstand to a folder?! We are already in your walled garden so please don't remind us of it.
Neg,@apple just now seeing none of my Microsoft Office programs work anymore after Lion upgrade. Why??
Neg,Dear @Apple I don't want the newsstand icon on my screen. #notcool
Neg,@Blackberry does take better quality photos than @Apple iPhone though. I give them that! #photograhersEye
Neg,I wish Siri could tweet for me . @apple fix that .
Neg,I will never purchase another @Apple product for the rest of my life. I am glad Steve Jobs is fucking dead. MAY YOU FUCKING ROT IN HELL!!!!!
Neg,Thanks to @Apple my new iMac is a brick. I cannot re-install Lion and I cannot purchase it because it was installed by the former owner.
Neg,Asked #Siri Where's Baby Lisa? and was told sorry I'm having trouble connecting to the network right now. @apple server fail. #ios5
Neg,Only thing #iOS.5 has done is deleted my tiger woods game and made impossible to retrieve. Thanks @Apple!
Neg,yo @apple this update is a disaster
Neg,Dear @AppleCongratulations I am suing my insurance company and you just managed to make it to the top of my shit list. #Ineedthosepictures
Neg,Dear @Apple: You must let me turn off iCloud to save bandwidth and NOT delete EVERY document on my iPad. That's BULLSHIT!
Neg,RT @JoelBurns: Dear @Apple it's me again. Thank for beautiful new iOS features. But I miss some of the old ones. Lk making calls & texts&gt;(

Neg,@hbogo @apple - why don't you play nice and let me use HDMI from iPad?  Pretty lame.
Neg,and only the first 23 images in my Photo Roll made it over? Seriously @apple how did you fuck this up so much?
Neg,@apple why does #iPhone4 plus #iOS5 equal half the battery life?
Neg,@apple why isn't my iTunes updating? I just wanna update my iPhone to IOS5!!! Then iTunes says that it needs to update to do it. Then fails!
Neg,need @apple help!! installing new ios on #iphone4 and am stuck on the Find My iPhone screen :( i keep clicking next but it doesn't work
Neg,Bummer that @Apple #iCloud syncs on Windows only w/ Outlook (not Thunderbird) & IE (not Firefox Chrome). #sadmac
